# CompSci project

### Information

The written report is called ```report.pdf```. All figures can be found in ```./figures```. There is a jupyter notebook for every question located in ```./Notebooks```. Additionally, some generic functionality can be found in ```models.py```, ```optimizers.py``` and ```utils.py``` in the same folder.

### Getting started

First, I would recommend to get conda which is a package manager that makes it easy to install and manage various packages and organize them in environments. You can get it here
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

To create a conda environment that includes the necessary packages, open a terminal and run
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To activate the environment, run
```
conda activate compsci-project
```

To start the jupyter notebook, run
```
jupyter notebook
```
